# task_6

**Subqueries and Nested Queries in SQL**


 **📚 Objective**
 
 Practice and demonstrate SQL subqueries for extracting data from one or more tables using:
 Subqueries in SELECT
 Subqueries in WHERE
 Subqueries in FROM

**🛠️ Tools Used**

 MySQL Workbench 
 
 DB Browser for SQLite

**🚀 Features Demonstrated**

1.Subqueries in SELECT (Scalar subquery)
2.Subqueries in WHERE with IN
3.Subqueries in WHERE with EXISTS
4.Correlated subqueries
5.Subqueries in FROM (Derived table)
6.Nested subqueries

**📜 SQL Queries Included**

1. Subquery in WHERE using IN
2. Subquery in WHERE using EXISTS
3. Scalar subquery in SELECT
4. Subquery in FROM (Derived Table)
5. Correlated subquery in WHERE
6. Nested subquery for max order
7. NOT EXISTS query

**🗂️ Files Included**

task_6.sql — SQL script file containing:
Table creation
Data insertion
All subquery examples in one file

README.md — This file (Documentation)

**🏃‍♂️ How to Run**

1. Open MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite.
2. Open the task_6.sql file.
3. Run the script to:
Create the tables.
Insert sample data.
Execute all subquery examples.
4. View the outputs in the Result pane.

**📑 Mini Guide (Mints)**

1.Use scalar subquery in SELECT to compute single value for each row.

2.Use WHERE with IN to filter by a list from a subquery.


3.Use WHERE with EXISTS for existence checks (correlated subquery).

4.Use subquery in FROM to create virtual tables.

5.Use correlated subqueries for row-wise comparisons.

6.Use nested subqueries for layered filtering.
